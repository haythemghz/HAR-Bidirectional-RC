# Results Documentation Guide

This document explains the structure and interpretation of the training results files generated by `train_with_logging.py`. These results are designed to be directly usable for paper enhancement and inclusion.

## Output Files

The training script generates two main output files:

1. **`training_results_TIMESTAMP.json`**: Comprehensive JSON file containing all experimental data
2. **`training_log_TIMESTAMP.txt`**: Human-readable log file with detailed training progress

## JSON Results Structure

The JSON file contains the following sections, each designed for specific paper sections:

### 1. `experiment_info`
**Purpose**: Experimental setup and reproducibility information
**Use in Paper**: Methods section, reproducibility statement

```json

  "start_time": "2025-12-17 20:44:09",
  "random_seed": 42,
  "device": "cpu"
}
```

**Key Metrics**:
- `random_seed`: For reproducibility
- `device`: Hardware used (CPU/GPU)

## Notes for Paper Writing

1. **Reproducibility**: Always report `random_seed` and `device` for reproducibility
2. **Statistical Significance**: Run multiple experiments with different seeds and report mean ± std
3. **Fair Comparison**: Ensure same train/test splits and evaluation protocols when comparing methods
4. **Computational Resources**: Report hardware specifications (CPU/GPU, RAM) for fair comparison
5. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Use results from different configurations for sensitivity analysis
